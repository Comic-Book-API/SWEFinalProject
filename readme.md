For our class project, we created a web applicaton, that allows user to use basic functionality such as, creating an account, logging into their account, and adding their favorite characters and comics underneath their username.

Our web application is a Marvel-Universe themed website. We implemented the Marvel API that allows us to go through their databases of information that stores comic books and characters. With the API, when the user searches for a specific comic book and/or character, it will populate the top 10 results of their search. With the populates results of the users' search, the user have the ability to click on the title of the comic and/or character and it will redirect the user to another page. For right now, the page has a Favorite button with no information displayed. Next sprint we'll polish it to have various information relevant to the user based on the comic/character. In addition, the users have the ability to take a quiz on their knowledge of the Marvel Universe.

We have implemented our own crypto encryption to keep our users' password/account protected.

We created our web application with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
